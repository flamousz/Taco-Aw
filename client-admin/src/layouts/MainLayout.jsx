/*

This code defines a React component called MainLayout. It imports two things from the React Router DOM library: Outlet and Navbar.

The Navbar component is a custom component that likely renders a navigation bar for the website.

The Outlet component is a special component provided by React Router that allows child components to be rendered depending on the current URL. It is a placeholder that will render the child routes specified in the router configuration.

In the MainLayout component, Navbar is rendered at the top of the page and Outlet is rendered in the body of the page. This means that any child routes that match the current URL will be rendered inside the Outlet component.

Overall, this component is used as a layout that wraps around other components in order to provide consistent styling and functionality across the website.


In React, a component can render other components as its children. These components that are rendered inside a parent component are referred to as child components. The parent component can pass data to its child components as props and the child components can also pass data back to the parent component by invoking functions that were passed down to them as props.

In the code example you provided, the MainLayout component is a parent component that renders two child components - Navbar and Outlet. The Navbar component displays a navigation bar and the Outlet component renders the child components of the currently matched route. So, depending on which route is currently active, different child components will be rendered within the Outlet component.
