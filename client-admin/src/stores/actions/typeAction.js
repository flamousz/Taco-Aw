/*

This code defines several constants that will be used as action types in Redux.

FOOD_FETCH_DATA is used to fetch food data.

CATEGORY_FETCH_DATA is used to fetch category data.

INGREDIENT_DETAIL_FETCH_DATA is used to fetch detail information about an ingredient.

IS_LOADING_TRUE is used to set the loading state to true.

IS_LOADING_FALSE is used to set the loading state to false.

By using constants as action types, it helps avoid errors that can occur from typos or other mistakes in action types.
